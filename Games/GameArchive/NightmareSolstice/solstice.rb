# Corrupt   >> Recover
# Recover   >> Abandoned
# Abandoned >> Corrupt

# If something is corrupted, it can be recovered. If recovered it can be abandoned. If Abandoned can be corrupted.

# Corrupted monsters are resistant to recovery. Recovered monsters are less likely to be abandoned. Abandoned monster are at increased risk of being corrupted, like aged software.

# Recover can be beat corruption if you solve a puzzle. Unsolved puzzles risk being abandoned, and therefore at increased risk of corruption.
